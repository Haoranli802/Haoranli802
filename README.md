1 Word Prediction with Word2Vec and LSTM
<br/>
How do the RMSE of the predicted words compare with and without stop words (you can alternatively plot the histogram of F-scores of the matched closest words)? 
<br/>
The RMSE values of the collection with stop words are all smaller than the RMSE values of the collection without stop words.
<br/>
<br/>
How does the quality of the prediction compare? 
<br/>
The quality of the prediction seems to improve with stop words.
