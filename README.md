1 Word Prediction with Word2Vec and LSTM
How do the RMSE of the predicted words compare with and without stop words (you can alternatively plot the histogram of F-scores of the matched closest words)? 
The RMSE values of the collection with stop words are all smaller than the RMSE values of the collection without stop words.

How does the quality of the prediction compare? 
The quality of the prediction seems improved with stop words.
